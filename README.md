# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Procedure
To be able to complete this project I did the following :

1) Installed Node and packages and included them in the server.js file. 

2) Added POST & GET routes to retrieve data from the server.

3) Signed up at the OpenWeatherMap website and acquired the API key.

4) Created async functions to fetch weather data and store the data on the local server.

5) Setting up a function in order to dynamically update the UI.

## References
I used the starter code provided by Udacity, and checked Stackoverflow and simillar platforms when I had problems.
I also watched the walk through webinar to get further help.
